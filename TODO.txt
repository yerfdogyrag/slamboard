Feature ideas:
- Boxes (B)
  - Default mode is "selected"
  - Coordinates are the center of the box
  - In selected mode, mouse movements resize the box (it can be any of the 4 corners)
  - SHIFT switches to box move
  - C - allow color change
  - W - change line width
  - B - complete box, leaving in current location
  - T - text mode (select from a list or just type.  Esc or Enter to exit?)

- Arrow mode (a)
  - Click to select first item (boxes likely), e changes edge, press a when done
  - Click to select second item, e changes edge, press a
  - W - change line width
  - S - switch arrow style

Easy starting
- Shift - pan.  Should change mouse cursor type and will change the view setting.

- Add additional colors (blue, green, yellow, black)

- Add a line-width pull-down

- Holding down Z should zoom as mouse moves (Z to stop)

Gary TODO
- Get coordinate conversion working
- Add keystroke and keystroke handler states
